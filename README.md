     Predicting Tomatometer Scores with Movie Attributes
</p>

 ## Overview
This research is an attempt to help film studios in deciding which movies to green-light by using a tool that will predict the quality of a potential movie.  This tool will attempt to predict Tomatometer Rating and Tomatometer Status by using movie characteristics which would be known prior to a movie production starting.

## Data
 The final dataset used for this research was made by compiling together pieces of two different datasets found on Kaggle â€“ one made from data scraped from Rottentomatoes.com and the other made from the Full MovieLens dataset.   This final dataset will be used to research the predictability of Tomatometer Scores (ranging from 0 to 100) and Tomatometer Statuses (Certified Fresh, Fresh, and Rotten) for movies before production has begun.  This will be attempted through both Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning regression models.
